      value: '<p>Making a decision about the best university to attend requires a lot of considered research and comparisons. Our university counsellor plays an important role in guiding our students through this, highlighting the important key decision-making factors. For example:</p><ul><li>What are the differences in the degrees offered by universities?</li><li>What are the benefits and challenges that come from different teaching styles</li><li>What are the available pathways through each degree?</li><li>What benefits and career opportunities exist at individual universities?</li></ul><p>Often university rankings play a leading role when students decide on their university of choice, but in reality, there are a number of criteria that shape the overall university experience. Our university counsellor will help our students understand the finer details about that experience, like the universityâ€™s location, opportunities, and expectations.</p>'
