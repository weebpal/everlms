The school is extremely proud of how they coped with the heat, the cold, the distances, the insects, the terrain and the thunderstorms. They designed, build and navigated rafts across great distances and then faced long hikes with their equipment and food in order to be totally self-sufficient. In fifteen years of taking pupils out on trips in Asia it is one of the most impressive accomplishments I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing â€“ we have some truly remarkable pupils at BVIS.</p>'
