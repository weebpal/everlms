      value: '<p>Establishing rapport is the first guiding principle in using demonstration in the teaching-learning process. This involves building a positive and trusting relationship between the teacher and the learners. By establishing rapport, the teacher creates a comfortable and supportive environment, which enhances the effectiveness of the demonstration. It helps in engaging the learners, gaining their attention, and fostering open communication. When there is a good rapport, learners are more likely to be motivated, participate actively, and have a better understanding of the demonstrated concepts or skills.</p>'
